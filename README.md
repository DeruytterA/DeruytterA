## About me
I'm in my second [bachelor of sciences in informatics](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/bachelor-of-science-in-computer-science) at the [University of Ghent](https://www.ugent.be/en).

Currently I'm writing my first website using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and working on enhancing some of my older projects.

I can write C, Java, Python, javascript, Kotlin and Haskell code (not in any particular order). Although I am definitely better at some than others.
